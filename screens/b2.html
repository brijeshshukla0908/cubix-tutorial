  <h1>C Programming for Loop</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Loops are used in programming to repeat a specific block of var. After reading this tutorial, you will learn to create for loop in C programming.</p>

  <p id="1">Loops are used in programming to repeat a block of var until a specific condition is met. There are three loops in C programming:</p>
  <ol>
	<li>for loop</li>
	<li><a href="b3.html">while loop</a></li>
	<li><a href="b3.html">do...while loop</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="2">for Loop</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;The syntax of for loop is:</p>
  <p class="example">
  for (initializationStatement; testExpression; updateStatement)<br>
  {<br>
       // codes<br> 
  }</p>
  <hr />
  <h3 id="3"></a>How for loop works?</h3>
  <p>The initialization statement is executed only once.</p>
  <p>Then, the test expression is evaluated. If the test expression is false (0), for loop is terminated. But if the test expression is true (nonzero), vars inside the body of <var>for</var> loop is executed and the update expression is updated.</p>
  <p>This process repeats until the test expression is false.</p>
  <p>The <var>for</var> loop is commonly used when the number of iterations is known.</p>

  <h3 id="5">Example: for loop</h3>
  <p class="example">
   // Program to calculate the sum of first n natural numbers   <br>
   // Positive integers 1,2,3...n are known as natural numbers   <br>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;   <br>
   int main()   <br>
  {   <br>
    int num, count, sum = 0;   <br>
    printf(&quot;Enter a positive integer: &quot;);   <br>
    scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;num);   <br>
    // for loop terminates when n is less than count   <br>
    for(count = 1; count &lt;= num; ++count)   <br>
    {   <br>
        sum += count;   <br>
    }   <br>
    printf(&quot;Sum = %d&quot;, sum);   <br>
    return 0;   <br>
  }
  </p>
  <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
  <p class="example">
  Enter a positive integer: 10   <br>
   Sum = 55</p>
  <p>The value entered by the user is stored in variable <var>num</var>. Suppose, the user entered 10.</p>
  <p>The <var>count</var> is initialized to 1 and the test expression is evaluated. Since, the test expression <var>count &lt;= num</var> (1 less than or equal to 10) is true, the body of for loop is executed and the value of <var>sum</var> will equal to 1.</p>
  <p>Then, the update statement <var>++count</var> is executed and count will equal to 2. Again, the test expression is evaluated. Since, 2 is also less than 10, the test expression is evaluated to true and the body of for loop is executed. Now, the <var>sum</var> will equal 3.</p>
  <p>This process goes on and the sum is calculated until the count reaches 11.</p>
  <p>When the count is 11, &nbsp;the test expression is evaluated to 0 (false) as 11 is not less than or equal to 10. Therefore, the loop terminates and next, the total sum is printed.</p>
