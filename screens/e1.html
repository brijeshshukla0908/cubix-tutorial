  <p id="1">Pointers are powerful features of C and (C++) programming that differentiates it from other popular programming languages like&nbsp;Java and Python.</p>
  <p>Pointers are used in C program to access the memory and manipulate the address.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2 id="2">Address in C</h2>
  <p>Before you get into the concept of pointers, let&#39;s first get familiar with address in C.</p>
  <p>If you have a variable <var>var</var> in your program, <var>&amp;var</var> will give you its address in the memory, where <var>&amp;</var> is commonly called the reference operator.</p>
  <p>You must have seen this notation while using <var>scanf()</var> function. It was used in the function to store the user inputted value in the address of <var>var</var>.</p>
  <p class="example">scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;var);</p>
  <p class="example">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;     <br>
  int main()    <br>
  {    <br>
   int var = 5;    <br>
   printf(&quot;Value: %d\n&quot;, var);    <br>
   printf(&quot;Address: %u&quot;, &amp;var);    <br>
   return 0;    <br>
  }
  </p>
  <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
  <p class="example">
  Value: 5     <br>
  Address: 2686778</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may obtain different value of address while using this code.</p>
  <p>In above source code, value 5 is stored in the memory location 2686778. <var>var</var> is just the name given to that location.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2 id="3">Pointer variables</h2>
  <p>In C, you can create a special variable that stores the address (rather than the value). This variable is called pointer variable or&nbsp;simply&nbsp;a pointer.</p>
  <p><strong>How to create a pointer variable?</strong></p>
  <p class="example">
  data_type* pointer_variable_name;    <br>
  int* p;
  </p>
  <p>Above statement defines, <var>p</var> as pointer variable of type <var>int</var>.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3 id="4">Reference operator (&amp;) and Dereference operator (*)</h3>
  <p>As discussed, <var>&amp;</var> is called reference operator. It gives you the address of a variable.</p>
  <p>Likewise, there is another operator that gets you the value from the address, it is called a dereference operator&nbsp; <var>*</var>.</p>
  <p>Below example clearly demonstrates the use of pointers, reference operator and dereference operator.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <var>*</var> sign when declaring a pointer is not a dereference operator. It is just a similar notation that creates a pointer.</p>

  <h3 id="5">Example: How Pointer Works?</h3>
  <p class="example">
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    <br>
   int main()    <br>
  {    <br>
   int* pc, c;     <br>
   c = 22;    <br>
   printf(&quot;Address of c: %u\n&quot;, &amp;c);    <br>
   printf(&quot;Value of c: %d\n\n&quot;, c);    <br>
   pc = &amp;c;    <br>
   printf(&quot;Address of pointer pc: %u\n&quot;, pc);    <br>
   printf(&quot;Content of pointer pc: %d\n\n&quot;, *pc);       <br>
   c = 11;    <br>
   printf(&quot;Address of pointer pc: %u\n&quot;, pc);    <br>
   printf(&quot;Content of pointer pc: %d\n\n&quot;, *pc);    <br>
   *pc = 2;    <br>
   printf(&quot;Address of c: %u\n&quot;, &amp;c);    <br>
   printf(&quot;Value of c: %d\n\n&quot;, c);    <br>
   return 0;    <br>
  }
  </p>
  <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
  <p class="example">
   Address of c: 2686784    <br>
   Value of c: 22    <br>
        <br>
   Address of pointer pc: 2686784    <br>
   Content of pointer pc: 22    <br>
            <br>
   Address of pointer pc: 2686784    <br>
   Content of pointer pc: 11    <br>
              <br>
   Address of c: 2686784    <br>
   Value of c: 2

  <h3 id="6">Common mistakes when working with pointers</h3>
  <p>Suppose, you want pointer <var>pc</var> to point to the address of <var>c</var>. Then,</p>
  <p class="example">
  int c, *pc;    <br>
  // Wrong! pc is address whereas,     <br>
  // c is not an address.    <br>
  pc = c;      <br>
  // Wrong! *pc is the value pointed by address whereas,     <br>
  // &amp;c is an address.    <br>
  *pc = &amp;c;     <br>
  // Correct! pc is an address and,     <br>
  // &amp;c is also an address.    <br>
  pc = &amp;c;     <br>
  // Correct! *pc is the value pointed by address and,     <br>
  // c is also a value (not address).    <br>
  *pc = c;
